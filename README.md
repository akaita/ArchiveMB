=========

Just an small Android app which takes some JSON data about artists and albums and shows them for you to browse.
Should perfectly work on Android 2.3+ devices, and most probably even on lower versions.

Included features
-------------------------

Progressive JSON parser (data is parsed as it arrives, not as a whole object)
Data cache using OMRLite
Asynchronous image download
Image caching thanks to Picasso
Paged image loading
Smooth and responsive (RecyclerView rocks!)
Integrated search
Basic error handling
Material style sliding tabs
Material style "swipe to update"
English and Spanish languages
